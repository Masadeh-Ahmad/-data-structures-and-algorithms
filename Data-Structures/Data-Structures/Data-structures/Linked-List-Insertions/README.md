# Challenge Summary
we have to create methods to append node to a linked list ,add before and add after 

## Whiteboard Process
![Linked-List-Insertions](./Linked-List-Insertions%20whiteboard.png )

## Approach & Efficiency
Append method O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity
Insert before method O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity
Insart after method O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity

## Solution
append
arguments: new value
adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list

insert before
arguments: value, new value
adds a new node with the given new value immediately before the first node that has the value specified

insert after
arguments: value, new value
adds a new node with the given new value immediately after the first node that has the value specified
