# Singly Linked List
We create a Linked List 

## Challenge
The Challenge is to create a Linked List and some method like insart and includes and ToString

## Approach & Efficiency
The creation will take O(1) space and time complexity
The includes method will take O(1) for space complexity and O(n) time complexity
The insart method will take O(1) space and time complexity
The ToString method will take O(n) for the time complexity and O(1) for the space complexity

## API
insert
Arguments: value
Returns: nothing
Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list 

includes
Arguments: value
Returns: Boolean
Indicates whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.

to string
Arguments: none
Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
"[ a ] -> [ b ] -> [ c ] -> NULL"
